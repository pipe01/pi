# pi
A language I've built from scratch just to learn, inspired by C# and TypeScript. The interpreter can't really be called that at the moment, I don't think I'll finish it.

Sample code:
```ts
public class test
{
	public function asd()
	{
		let asd : type = !(my.mdas).butt();
	}

	public dasdasd : int = 123;
}
```
